                <p class="para">Cloudflare, Inc. is a U.S. company that provides content delivery network services, DDoS mitigation, Internet security and distributed domain name server services, sitting between the visitor and the Cloudflare user's hosting provider, acting
                  as a reverse proxy for websites. Cloudflare's headquarters are in San Francisco, California, with additional offices in London, Singapore, Champaign, Austin, Boston and Washington, D.C.<br>
                  Cloudflare was created in 2009 by Matthew Prince, Lee Holloway, and Michelle Zatlyn, who had previously worked on Project Honey Pot. Cloudflare was launched at the September 2010 TechCrunch Disrupt conference. It received media attention in June
                  2011, after providing security to LulzSec's website. In June 2012, Cloudflare partnered with various web hosts, including HostPapa, to implement its "Railgun" technology. In February 2014, Cloudflare mitigated the largest-ever recorded DDoS
                  attack at that time, which peaked at 400 Gbit/s against an undisclosed customer. In November 2014, Cloudflare reported another massive DDoS attack with independent media sites being targeted at 500 Gbit/s.</p>
